## Spotify Playlist Server

This code represents a basic Spotify Playlist Server implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints to manage a playlist, including adding songs, playing songs, and retrieving the list of songs. The server listens on a specified port, either 3000 or the environment variable `PORT`.

### Prerequisites

To run the server, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

2. The server will start running and listening on the specified port.

3. Use an HTTP client (such as Postman or cURL) to interact with the server's endpoints.

### Endpoints

#### GET /

- Description: Retrieves all songs in the playlist.
- Method: GET
- URL: `/`
- Response Format: JSON
- Response Body Example:
  ```
  [
    {
      "title": "Song 1",
      "artists": ["Artist 1"],
      "url": "https://spotify.com/song1"
    },
    {
      "title": "Song 2",
      "artists": ["Artist 2"],
      "url": "https://spotify.com/song2"
    }
  ]
  ```

#### GET /play

- Description: Plays a song from the playlist.
- Method: GET
- URL: `/play`
- Response Format: JSON
- Response Body Example:
  ```
  {
    "message": "Playing song: Song 1"
  }
  ```

#### POST /add

- Description: Adds a song to the playlist.
- Method: POST
- URL: `/add`
- Request Format: JSON
- Request Body Example:
  ```
  {
    "title": "New Song",
    "artists": ["Artist 3"],
    "url": "https://spotify.com/newsong"
  }
  ```
- Response Format: JSON
- Response Body Example:
  ```
  {
    "message": "Song added to the playlist successfully"
  }
  ```

### Error Handling

- If a route is not found, the server responds with a 404 status code and a JSON error message:
  ```
  {
    "status": "Failed!",
    "message": "Page Not Found!"
  }
  ```

- If an error occurs in the server, it is caught by the error handling middleware. The server responds with an appropriate status code and error message:
  ```
  {
    "status": 500,
    "message": "Something Went Wrong!"
  }
  ```

### Customization

- You can modify the server's port by changing the `PORT` variable in the code.

- To implement the actual functionality for retrieving, adding, and playing songs, modify the handler functions in the `handler.js` file.

### Conclusion

The Spotify Playlist Server provides a simple API to manage a playlist. It allows adding songs, retrieving the playlist, and playing songs. You can customize the server's functionality and error handling as per your specific requirements.
